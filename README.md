# A-Pathfinding-Visual
This is an attempt to visualize the A* Pathfinding Algorithm and use it to solve a Maze.

It first creates a Maze using the Maze-Generation-Algorithm, then uses the A* Pathfinding Algorithm to find a way through the maze

## Running
One way to view the algorithm working, is visiting the link [jaikiratsingh.github.io/A-Pathfinding-Visual](jaikiratsingh.github.io/A-Pathfinding-Visual)

An Alternate Way can be to run it on the local server. Follow the instructions below to do so.
## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/jaikiratsingh/A-Pathfinding-Visual.git
cd A-Pathfinding-Visual
npm install -g http-server
```

## Running
